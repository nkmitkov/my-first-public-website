			<h2>My Story.</h2>
			<p class="paragraph">
				My whole professional carreer, which is around 8years, I'm working in hospitality industry. I was working in resturants, bars, hotels and golf clubs. I also graduated College of Tourism - Varna, Bulgaria and my Bachelor degree is in "Management in hotels and restaurants". Thanks to my college I was able to travel 4 times to United States. Twice I was on a Work and Travel program for the summer and twice on an Internship program. I was able to meet people from all over the world, to get familiar with different cultures, to learn so many new things and to visit many places. I'm very grateful for everything I've been thrue, but I always felt that hospitality it's not the area I would like work my whole life. From a couple of years I'm thinking about my future and trying to make a change. I've always been interested in computers. First, I was playing games for a couple of years. Then I start with the social media like everyone else. And from a few months I'm interested in Web Development. I just finished online courses for HTML, CSS and JavaScipt.
